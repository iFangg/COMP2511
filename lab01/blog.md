## What do you want to get out of this course?
I want to have finished the course having learnt a new language and potentially more skills I can use in the future.

## What skills do u want to develop and improve?
I want to improve my problem solving skills, and develop my java knowledge as well as a specific method of thinking that might come hand in hand with learning java - i.e how problems are uniquely solved with java compared to other langauges.

## What do u think will be the biggest challenge of the course? 
Putting the skills and knowledge I've been taught and applying those to problems.

### How will you go about meeting this challenge?
Consistency is key, I need to code or read up on lecture material or even do some extra reading/projects on the side to really retain everything that I learn.
